# Pastion

This application will randomize a string of characters. It's almost like an encryptor but it doesn't decrypt. Characters will move depending on the number (a random number
that is the length of the raw password). The movement is dependent on 2 numbers product that are complimentary to one another (i, i + 1). The 'hashed' result can be changed
with the object literal ('keys') . This application has a simple UI made with html and css
